// Expressions and Statements:

// Expression :

// Expression is small piece of code which actually produce some kind of value, For instance ;

// 10 + 7 => The value is going to be 17 so this is an expression
// 2020 => This is alos an expression although this is just a Number.

// true && false || !true => This will also produce some kind of value so this is also an expression.

// Statement :

// Statement is a big piece of code which doesn't produce a value although it produce result For-Example:

// if/else statement :
// switch statement :

if ((age = 21)) {
  console.log("You are too young for this");
}

// The above code is producing a sentence
//  as result, but not the value,so this is called statement :

// Expresions produce value and statements are like full sentence that translate our actions ;
