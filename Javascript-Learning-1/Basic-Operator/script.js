//Basic Operators

// Math operator:
const weight = 54;
const qasWeight = weight + 20;
// console.log(qasWeight);

const jjWeight = weight + 20;
// console.log(jjWeight);

// or;
console.log(qasWeight, jjWeight);

const firstName = "Qas";
const lastName = "Javed";

console.log(firstName + lastName);
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName);
// This is how we can concatinate the two Strings :
// 1st console will show the name without space and 2nd one is gonna show with the space.

// Assignment Operator:

let x = 10 + 10;

x += 10; // it means x= x +10=30
x++; //x = x + 1;
x--; //x=x-1; "--"double "-"decrease the value by 1

console.log(x);

// Comparison operators:
console.log(qasWeight > jjWeight);
